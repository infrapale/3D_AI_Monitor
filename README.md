# 3D_AI_Monitor
### Monitor the progress of 3D printing using machine learning
### Implementation options that may end up to be all used
* Visual monitoring using AI
* Noise monitoring using AI
* Vibration monitoring with threshold value


# Visual monitoring

#### Timelapse photo is woking fine and pictures are sent to the main Raspberry. So far the ML is running on my PC. Pictures may require further manipulation to improve the accuracy
# Audio monitoring
